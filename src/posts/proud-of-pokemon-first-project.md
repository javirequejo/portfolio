It's really common to hear developers say that they are not really happy with their code in the beginning of their programming career. The best way to learn to code is build something from scratch but when we start, we don't know the best practices to write clean code, what is the best way to organize the project structure or simply, we turn easy problems into complex solutions.

I decided to take programming in a professional way when I started a web development bootcamp at Ironhack two years ago (you can read my experience here), and one of the things more heard by the teachers was that when a year pass, we would be a little ashamed looking at our code.
