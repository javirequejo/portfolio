Hey there! Welcome to my first post!

My name is Javi and I'm a spanish developer living in UK.

## My story

From 2013 I was working in the insurance sector but I end up there for family reasons, so I was not happy with my career.

In 2018, I decided to leave the job and I started a bootcamp in web development at Ironhack. It was a good change for me because I always liked the computers and programming things as a hobby.

At the bootcamp, I studied and learnt about front and back end development, specifically focussed on practising with Javascript.

I did my best and I was hired shortly after by a startup company in Spain, Alterna, where I have been working since.

In 2020, I decided to move to London because I wanted to improve my English and get the experience of living in other country.

Yes, in 2020, in the middle of this pandemic.

But until now, all is going very well. So, here we are!

## What will my blog go about

In this blog, I will be writing things about code, my life and related areas.

I would like to speak about my experience changing to tech from a non related field and all the things that I would like to have known when I faced that step in my life.

Moreover, I will be talking about things that I keep learning. This is a field where you have to keep up to date and there is always something new to learn.

So, I hope that this blog is helpful, or trying anyway üòÅ.
